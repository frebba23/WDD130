        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        [In Zimbabwe there are a few Web Designers. Those that are doing it are charging exorbitant prices. Most of the local websites, which are descent, are owned by very large companies. Small to medium enterprises, which makes up about 90% of the businesses in the country do not own descent websites. Those that do so have poorly structured web pages with content that is less coherent and distorted. Other websites are just similar showing laziness and lack of creativity on the part of the developer. That is where I step in with my business.
        BUSINESS PURPOSES
        AFFORDABILITY
          My business intends to address the above challenges. People who will come to my site will be looking for a web developer who will offer affordable prices and I will do that. My services will take into account the type of business, their income as well as their targeted audience.
        UNIQUENESS
          My websites will be unique and tailor made for the business that I am preparing for. I will take into account their customersâ€™ needs as well as their product type. I will ensure that the products layout on the page will be appealing to the eyes of the customers. This will all be done at affordable rates.
        KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS
          The visitors of my website would want to know if I am up to task with what I am offering. My website, which I would have developed myself, would act as proof that I am a competent web designer. It will be designed in a way that is appealing to the visitors. From that website they would know that I am good at web designing.

      <h3>[Consultansy Services]</h3>
      <p>
        CONSULTANCY ON WEB STRUCTURE
        I would also offer consultancy on web structures. I will advise my clients on the most suitable structure for their websites. Websites must be well structured in line with the services they offer. This would retain the interest of their visitors.
        CONSULTANCY ON WEB CONTENT
          I will also offer advice on the content on the websites of businesses. This would help my clients get move clicks and thus improving their business. Websites must be appealing to the people who visit them. If they are not then the customers would take their business somewhere. So the content on the website must be relevant. 
        STYLING ALREADY EXISTING WEBSITES
          I will also help with the styling of the websites. Interest is retained by vision so the visual presentation of a website must be good.  Most websites are not styled according to the business model. So the business model and the website bust be in sync.  So my business will also focus on that so as to widen the scope of my business.

        [ACTIVITIES BY VISITORS
        The visitors would be able to fill in some details as they apply for my services. They will also enter their business type and also what they expect their websites to display. I will use that information to have some ideas on what I want their websites to look like. 
      INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY VISITORS
        The information my website would require, as mentioned above, are the business details of the person requiring my services. These details would be placed on their website. However, the websites would be made according to their preferences.
