                <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
                <p>
                    In Zimbabwe there are a few Web Designers. Those that are doing it are charging exorbitant prices. Most of the local websites, which are descent, are owned by very large companies. Small to medium enterprises, which makes up about 90% of the businesses in the country do not own descent websites. Those that do so have poorly structured web pages with content that is less coherent and distorted. Other websites are just similar showing laziness and lack of creativity on the part of the developer. That is where I step in with my business.
                    BUSINESS PURPOSES
                    AFFORDABILITY
                    My business intends to address the above challenges. People who will come to my site will be looking for a web developer who will offer affordable prices and I will do that. My services will take into account the type of business, their income as well as their targeted audience.
                    UNIQUENESS
                    My websites will be unique and tailor made for the business that I am preparing for. I will take into account their customersâ€™ needs as well as their product type. I will ensure that the products layout on the page will be appealing to the eyes of the customers. This will all be done at affordable rates.
                    KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS
                    The visitors of my website would want to know if I am up to task with what I am offering. My website, which I would have developed myself, would act as proof that I am a competent web designer. It will be designed in a way that is appealing to the visitors. From that website they would know that I am good at web designing.
